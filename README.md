👨‍💻 Software Trainee | Former HR Specialist | Tech Enthusiast 🚀

🌟 About Me

👋 Hey there! I'm Joao, a passionate tech enthusiast who decided to make a career pivot from being a former HR Specialist to a Software Trainee at Pinto Brasil Group. 
Technology has been my calling from the beginning, and I'm on an exciting journey of continuous learning and growth in the world of software development.

🚀 My Journey

📚 I've been immersing myself in the world of code and have dabbled in various programming languages, including HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, C#, SQL, and PHP (with a special focus on Laravel framework). 
Currently, I'm honing my skills in VB.Net and SQL Server, with a focus on ERP Extensibility.

🔥 Let's Connect

🌐 I'm constantly expanding my knowledge, and GitHub is where I showcase my projects and contributions. Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me as we journey through the ever-evolving landscape of technology together.
